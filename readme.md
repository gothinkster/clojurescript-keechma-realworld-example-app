# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Keechma/next codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Keechma/next** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

Keechma/classic app can be found in the `keechma-classic` branch.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Keechma/next** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
